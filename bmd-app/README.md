# New Website

I have been asked by a local Bike Mechanic to create a new website for his small mobile bike repair business.

I'm creating a React app that will retrieve website information from Airtable, which the business owner uses to host his database.

I plan to create an online booking form, display the businesses google reviews, and all pricing information for bike repairs.
